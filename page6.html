He also has the ability to learn and to adapt to any special requirement for a job.</p><p>- <em>Vendor manager, McLehm Traductores</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Eric was an exceptional person to work with and has always delivered on what he commits to.”</strong></p><p>Eric did translation work on multimedia materials and ensured Spanish/English consistency among those materials and other documents. Eric was an exceptional person to work with and has always delivered on what he commits to.</p><p>– <em>Adam Shapiro</em></p><p><em>Head of Campaigns at Front Line Defenders</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Extremely responsible and meticulous … excellent understanding and use of legal language.”</strong></p><p>I would like to recommend Eric Schwartz, who has translated our organization's reports from Spanish to English since 2010. He has proven himself to be extremely responsible and meticulous in these activities and has shown excellent understanding and use of legal language.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr. Schwartz interpreted in a meeting with international delegates as part of the Campaign for the Right to Health. His excellent performance satisfied the international delegates, Colombian participants, and members of our organization.</p><p>For these reasons, the Corporación Jurídica Yira Castro strongly recommends him.</p><p>– <em>Claudia Liliana Erazo</em></p><p><em>Legal Representative</em></p><p><em>Corporación Jurídica Yira Castro</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“He has extensive experience in the translation of legal documents and is very knowledgeable about human rights work in Colombia.”</strong></p><p>The Foundation for Freedom of the Press has had the opportunity to work with Eric. His work with us has been very meticulous; he has extensive experience in the translation of legal documents and is very knowledgeable about human rights work in Colombia.</p><p>- <em>Pedro Vaca Villarreal</em></p><p><em>Executive Director of the Foundation for Freedom of the Press (FLIP)</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Eric was outstanding in the work. I highly recommend him as an interpreter and would certainly work with him again.”</strong></p><p>We traveled to several cities in Colombia while I was participating in workshops with teachers, with my presentations being about issues in technology and education.</p><p>Eric was outstanding in the work. He effectively interpreted for my presentations, both in consecutive interpretation from English to Spanish, and simultaneous interpretation from Spanish to English.</p><p>Throughout the activities I felt confident that the communication in both English and Spanish allowed for my full participation in the workshops.</p><p>Eric was very flexible in a variety of situations, adjusting to fit the evolving needs for interpretation.</p><p>I highly recommend him as an interpreter and would certainly work with him again.</p><p>- <em>Larry Kuehn, Ed.D., Director</em></p><p><em>Research and Technology Division</em></p><p><em>British Columbia Teachers' Federation</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“I wholeheartedly recommend his work.”</strong></p><p>I was fortunate enough to have Eric Schwartz as a translator [interpreter] at a training activity on women’s human rights, delivered to public servants in the judiciary.

I wholeheartedly recommend his work.</p><p>- <em>Lina Tatiana Lozano Ruiz</em></p><p><em>Consultant, International Organization for Migration (IOM)</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“He showed a great pride in doing his job well… I would highly recommend him.”</strong></p><p>Eric Schwartz and Kath Nygard worked as a team to provide translation [interpretation] for a program that my team carried out in Bogota in June of 2016. They both showed a strong work ethic and dedication to doing their jobs well. I also appreciated greatly the degree of flexibility Eric and Kath both showed during this program. When needed, they were willing and able to change up the interpretation format from simultaneous using headsets to whisper translating one-on-one for English speaking faculty members to interact with Spanish speaking participants. Eric in particular made sure to flag issues with the translation of some of our written materials to help us improve them for the next time we use these materials. He showed a great pride in doing his job well, and had a great disposition and personality. I very much enjoyed working with him, and hope to have a chance to work with him again some day. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for Spanish-English or English-Spanish translation!!</p><p>- <em>Gigi Scoles</em></p><p><em>Director of Legal Initiatives - Human Rights</em></p><p><em>Vital Voices Global Partnership</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Very careful with the terms that should be used and the exact meaning of each word.”</strong></p><p>I recommend Eric Schwartz's services as a translator. I have hired him to translate documents from Spanish to English several times, and I have been pleasantly surprised. He is very careful about the terms that should be used and the exact meaning of each word. He recently translated my feature film script and the comments from readers have been very complimentary.</p><p>– <em>Fernando López Cardona</em></p><p><em>Filmmaker</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“As well as providing a very competent service, he … showed a deep knowledge of the subject matter being discussed.”</strong></p><p>I attended a week-long event in Colombia on environmental justice and environmental popular education where Eric was interpreting. As well as providing a very competent service, he was also able to get on well with all participants, and showed a deep knowledge of the subject matter being discussed.</p><p>– <em>David Heller</em></p><p><em>Network Development at Friends of the Earth Europe</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“Positive results and excellent comments on the quality of the translated texts.”</strong></p><p>Mr. Schwartz has done several translations for the Latin American Institute for an Alternative Society and Law (ILSA), which were then circulated among international networks. Each time, Mr. Schwartz showed his commitment, dedication, and discipline in translating the documents entrusted to him.</p><p>Mr. Schwartz also accurately translates the technical vocabulary used in the human rights field and by non-governmental organizations.</p><p>Furthermore, Mr. Schwartz has worked for me personally, translating essays and resumes that I have used for various applications to win scholarships and participate in international events. The results have been positive and I have received excellent comments on the quality of the translated texts.</p><p>Mr. Schwartz delivers his translations on time and provides high-quality work.</p><p>– <em>Ana Lucía Maya Aguirre</em></p><p><em>Attorney and professor at the Universidad del Norte</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>“He is methodical, accurate, meticulous, and most importantly, he meets his commitments.”</strong></p><p>I wholeheartedly recommend Eric Schwartz’s services.</p><p>He has repeatedly provided translation services to our film production house, Medio de Contención Producciones Ltda., for English translation of documents about our films.</p><p>He is methodical, accurate, meticulous, and most importantly, he meets his commitments.</p><p>- <em>Hector Ulloque Franco</em></p><p><em>Filmmaker</em></p><p></p></div>
